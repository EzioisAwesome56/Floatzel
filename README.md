# Floatzel
## Setting up the bot
Go to the releases tab and download the jar for the newest version, then run it. It will generate a config.json file with the correct setup for floatzel.<br>
From there, it is as simple as entering in your details into the config.json file and running the bot.

If the version you wish to run does not provide a precompiled jar file, download the sources and compile it yourself.
## Requirements
this bot is written in Java 8, and confirmed to work in openjdk 8, 11, 16 and the openj9 versions of each.<br><br>
A database mod is required for this bot to be able to store information such as user bank accounts. If you do not wish to save any of this information, start the bot using the "-fallback" to load a driver that returns 0 and saves no data to a database.<br><br>
Imagemagick needs to be installed for a handful of the image commands to work<br><br>
Consult pom.xml for the rest of the requirements
