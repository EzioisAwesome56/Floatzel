# Floatzel
## Setting up the bot
Simply clone the bot, compile it, then run it. It will generate a config.json file with the correct setup for floatzel.<br>
From there, it is as simple as entering in your details into the config.json file and running the bot.
## Requirements
this bot is rewritten in Java 8, and confirmed to work in openjdk 8.<br>
The bot requires a rethinkDB server, without a password, running on the same machine that the bot is for database storage. Password options may be added later<br>
Consult pom.xml for the rest of the requirements
## Plugin api
As of 2.5.1, you can now write new commands for floatzel via javascript plugins!<br>
you can find the documentation for the api [here](https://github.com/EzioisAwesome56/Floatzel/wiki/Plugin-API-documentation)
