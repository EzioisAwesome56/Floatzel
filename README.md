# Floatzel
## Setting up the bot
simply clone the repo, and then rename `ConfigStock.java` to just `Config.java` then just fill in all of the information asked for in the file. Then just compile the bot and you should be good to go!
## Requirements
this bot is rewritten in Java 8, and confirmed to work in openjdk 8.
Consult pom.xml for the rest of the requirements
## Credits
Many thanks to [Godson777 on github](https://github.com/Godson777) for all of the help he has given me for this project. without him I would still be beating Floatzel Classic's code into the ground/
