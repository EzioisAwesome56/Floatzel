# Floatzel
## Setting up the bot
Simply clone the bot, compile it, then run it. It will generate a config.json file with the correct setup for floatzel.<br>
From there, it is as simple as entering in your details into the config.json file and running the bot.
## Requirements
this bot is written in Java 8, and confirmed to work in openjdk 8.<br>
A rethinkdb server running on the bot's host is required for data storage. Username and password options can be set in the configuration file<br>
Consult pom.xml for the rest of the requirements
