# Floatzel
## Setting up the bot
Simply clone the bot, compile it, then run it. It will generate a config.json file with the correct setup for floatzel.<br>
From there, it is as simple as entering in your details into the config.json file and running the bot.
## Requirements
this bot is written in Java 8, and confirmed to work in openjdk 8, 11, 16 and the openj9 versions of each.<br><br>
A database mod is required for this bot to be able to store information such as user bank accounts. If you do not wish to save any of this information, start the bot using the "-fallback" to load a driver that returns 0 and saves no data to a database.<br><br>
Consult pom.xml for the rest of the requirements
